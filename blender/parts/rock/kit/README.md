# The Holm tip's rock, the street's way

Nature restarted on the street's recipe (29 October): the tip's rock made as a small kit of rigid parts, each made
with care, assembled by a generator from `fixtures/lt1-holm-tip.json`, with house 107 in every frame, in the street's
finish, light and cameras. The first lane's meshes are not used; its exposure rule, `WEAR` table, foliation and
zonation are (`../README.md`).

## Hand-over (kept current at each commit)

- **Where:** parts and generator here (`blender/parts/rock/kit/`), the scene `unity/Assets/Experiments/LT1/Nature/HolmTip.unity`
  built by `Nature/Editor/LT1HolmTip.cs`, renders in `cache/rock/kit/renders/<round>/`.
- **The pipeline is the street's, called unchanged:**
  - `part.py` builds a part's levels as `geom.to_object` builds a house's (uv0, page, Col, rest, piece; face-weighted
    normals), charts packed by `geom.Charts`, and writes `house-<level>.fbx` and a `house.json` with the fields the
    street's Unity code reads, so `LT1Street`'s import and materials take a rock unchanged. Budgets by surface, as
    `street.json`'s (a square metre of rock may cost what a square metre of house does), enforced at export.
  - `bake.py` bakes the page with the finish's bake (`finish/bake.py` helpers, as `street/bake.py` does).
  - `paint.py` writes the page's marks with p3's rules (`finish.json` `painted`, unchanged) and the digest.
  - `LT1HolmTip.cs` builds the scene and calls `LT1Street`'s import, materials, lights and capture by reflection.
- **Order:** 1 port one part beside 107 (look-in 1); 2 target frame (look-in 2); 3 the kit, 6–8 parts (look-in 3);
  4 assemble (look-in 4); 5 done sheet.
- **Run:** `Blender -b --factory-startup -P blender/parts/rock/kit/part.py -- --part <p> --out cache/rock/kit/gen/<p>`;
  then `bake.py` and `paint.py` with `-- --gen cache/rock/kit/gen/<p> --cache cache/rock/kit/bake/<p>`; then
  `python3 tools/unity_lock.py run -- bash blender/parts/rock/kit/run/render.sh <round>`; sheets by `blender/parts/rock/sheet.py`
  (`-- OUT.png COLS IMG...`), shrunk with `sips -Z 2560` into `reviews/lt1/rock/<round>/`.
- **The house** is the street's current 107 (kit.json `beside`: `gen`, `paint`), checked by md5 against
  `Street/Generated/107`; when the street rebuilds 107, update both. k01 took a stale pair (page painted before the mesh
  was rebuilt): streaked roof and reveals, no boards.
- **State (29 Oct):** Look-in 1 sent at k02; waiting for the coordinator. Next is the part's making (see k02), not a patch.

## Rounds

- **k02** (`reviews/lt1/rock/k02/`; rows eye overcast, eye low sun, street overcast, street low sun; columns floor P,
  rock P, floor Pc, rock Pc). Bad: the block reads as made, not grown: four plates of flat faces with rounded rims, a cast
  slab or a gravestone, the tiles Øystein named; no lamination inside a face, no ledges, no break. Bad: the eye frame cuts
  its foot (`eye.from` must stand off the part's front, not its middle); its page costs 0.26 MB/m² to 107's 0.08.
  Good: 107 is the street's again, and the rock takes the street's pipeline, light and finish unchanged.
  Cost: 107 near 24590 tris / 11 draws, street 5459 / 11, city 705 / 1, 12 materials, page 21.3 MB; slab-block near
  1263 / 1, street 360 / 1, city 14 / 1, 1 material, page 5.3 MB (1024 BC7 ×4); strokes 1.3 MB shared.
